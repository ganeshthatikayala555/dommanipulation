# dommanipulation
here js is used to manipulate dom structure of webpage
so js is used to communicate with dom ..which is stored in memory
js along with blink(engine-also called rendering engine which renders webpages)
is used to modify specific content of dom ,,browser or v8 engine interpretes it
and blink rerenders the updated content..react enhances this technology
here at first,an html dom containing button is rendered,,when we click button 
the dom is updated and structure of dm changes in memory,,,but instead of rerendering whole dom ..
the engine rerenders only updated content
